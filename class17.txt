Static
-----
It is a non access modifier which is applicable for methods and variables only.

Method Hiding
--------------
Whenever we are declaring static method in the child class which is already present in the parent class 
where we will keep the method declaration same but by changing the implementation is known as the process of Method hiding.

In method hiding the method resolution takes place on the basis of object reference side and compiler is responsible for the method resolution .
It is otherwise known as compile time polymorphism

class Tommy{
public static void m1(){
	System.out.prinln("Hii");
}

}
public class VDY extends Tommy{
	public static void m1(){
		System.out.println("Hello");	
	}
	public static void main(String... a){
		Tommy m = new Tommy();
		m.m1();
		VDY y=new VDY();
		y.m1();
		Tommy y1=new VDY();
		y1.m1();	
	}
}
