Assignment Operator(=)

It is used to assign values to variables
There are three types of assignment operator

1. Simple assignment operator
int x = 10;
2.Chained assignment operator
int a = b = c = d = 10;
3.Compound Assignment operator
int x = 10;
x += 20; // 30

d = 10 c = 200 b = -180 a = -160

b++ <-> b+=1 <-> b=(byte)(b+1);
e.g., byte b = 10;
b+=1;
sopl(b); // 11

Equality Operator = Double Equal Operator
It is applicabe for all types of primitive variables including boolean .

sopln(10 == 20); // false
sopln('a' == 97.0); // true
sopln(false == false); // true

Equality operator is applicable for non primitive data types.
The number given by the heap manager is converted to hexadecimal and is stored in the object reference which is then recognised by the jvm.

For two object references r1 and r2 r1 ==  r2 returns true if both references are pointing towards same object and r1 == r2 returns false if both references are pointing towards different objects.
t1 is an reference of an object
t1 == null will be false.

All non primitive variables can only store 2 types of values one is the object and another is null.

Bitwise Operator
&& || ^
xor returns true in case iff both are different.
