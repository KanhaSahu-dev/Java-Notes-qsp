Printing the return value of a method
----------------------------------
We can print return the value of method in the following ways
1) by storing in a variable

int x = m1();

2) Directly
---------
sopln(m1());

the type of return type determines the type of return statement.

If a method has non primitive return type then it can return null or object of that  type.

public static Test m1(){
sopln("m1-method");
return new Test();
}

After return statement we cannot print any other statement 

Methods in signature
-------------------
Method signature consists of method name and the argument's data type.
Two methods with the same signature within a class is not allowed in java.
