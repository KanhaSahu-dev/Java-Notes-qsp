In switch case duplicate case is not allowed 
int x =97;
switch(x){
case 97:
sopln(97);
break;
case 'a':
sopln(99);
break;
}
output is compilation error.

case label should be constant expression, case label should not be duplicate .

DEFAULT
--------

It is optional, we can write default at most once.

It is not mandatory to write the default case as the last case.
	
	-If any case matches from that case onwards all the statements will be executed untill break or end of 	switch.This is known as fall through inside switch.
	e.g., switch(x){
case 0:
sopln(0);
case 1:
sopln(1);
break;
case 3:
sopln(3);
default:
sopln("def"); // x = 0 is 0 and 1 , x = 1 is 1 and for x = 3 result is 3 and def.
}

LOOPING STATEMENT
--------------------

for :-

When we know the exact number of iteration then we should go for loop .
for(int i = 0; i<3; i++){
sopln("hii");
} // hii hii hii

Initialisation part :- 

This part is executed only once , int i = 0;String s = "abc"; will be wrong.
We can declare any number of variables  in the initialisation part but it should be of same type .
We can write printing statement in the initialisation part. (check code)

Condition part:- 
If we are not providing any condition in the condition part then compiler will always place true in the condition part.
