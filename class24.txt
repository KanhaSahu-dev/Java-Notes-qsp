Identification of static membes from to top to bottom. In that identification j will also be identifed then j will assigned as 0 as it's a static variable.

Execution of static variable assignment & static blocks from top to bottom.

Execution of main method.



class a{
    static int i = 10;
    static {
        m1();
        sopln("fsb");
    }

    p s v m(){
        m1();
        sopln("main");
    }

    p s v m1(){
        sopln(j);
    }
    static {
        sopln("ssb");
    }
    static int j = 20;
}

output :- 0 fsb ssb 20 main

Instace or Non Static  Block
--------------------------
Instance block is a block which will be executed whenever we create an object.
It will be called as many times as you create the object.
If we have more than one instance block in a class then instance block will be executed from top to bottom.
e.g.,
{
sopln("hii");
}

If we have constructors and instance block then instance block is executed first then the constructor.

All every non static blocks or methods or variales can only be called or executed with the help of object.

class a{
int i = 10;
{
m1();
sopln("const");
}
psvm(){
a a1 = new a();
sopln("main");
a a2  = new a();
}
public void m1(){
sopln(j);
}
{
sopln("sib");
}
int j =20
}



class a{
static {
sopln("fsb");
}
{
sopln("fib");
}
A(){
sopln("const");
}
psvm(){
a a1 = new a();
sopln("main");
a a2 = new a();
}
static {
sopln("ssb");
}
{
sopln("sib");
}
}
