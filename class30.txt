Finalization
============


finalize() // The most easiest topic acc. to sir LoL.
-----------
It is used to deallocate or to perform the cleanup activites not the main thing is to destroy.
It is a method which is called by a garbage collector to destroy useless objects
An object without any reference is known as useless object/garbage object.


Ways to make an object useless
------------------------------
The moment the the object loses it's reference then the object can be called as useless object
We can do that by assigning the null to the reference variable

1.
If an object is no longer required then assign null to it's reference variale then that object will become useless... this process is known as nullifying the reference variable.

Test t1 = new Test();
Test t2 = new Test();

t1 = null;//Object becomes useless object.
t2 = null;//Object becomes useless object.

2.Reassigning the reference variable
If an object is no longer required then assign a new object to it's reference variable then the old object will become useless ...Reassigning the reference variable.

Test t1 = new Test();
Test t2 = new Test();
t1 = new Test();//1 object is eligible for GC.
t2 = t1;//2 objects are eligible for GC.

Object created inside the method.
---------------------------------
Q. 
class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        m1();//2 objects are eligible for GC.
    }
    public static void m1(){
        Test t1=new Test();
        Test t2=new Test();
    }
}

Island of Isolation
--------------------
class Test{
    Test i;
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Test t1=new Test();
        Test t2=new Test();
        Test t3=new Test();
    }
}

When an object is useless then jvm is called which calls the garbage collector , garbage collector asks last wish , if some data base and n/w base is connected , then it is first deconnected by the GC.

class Test{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Test t = new Test();
        t=null;
        System.gc();//Called jvm GC came.
        //Even when we dont call the finalize method the GC is automatically called by the jvm.
        //GC is called which calls finalise.
    }
        public void finalize(){
            System.out.println("finalize method called");
        }
}

Whenever we call the main method a main thread is created,in java whatever is executed it is done by the thread.

Garbage collector is another thread.

If we have more than one thread in one program then the order in which the output is shown is not determined.

If a child thread is in the parent thread then we have the same priority.

Garbage collector's main work is to call the finalize method.

If we call finalise() method on a particular class object then the corresponsing class finalize method will be executed.

String class finalize() has empty implementation.
