Running the java files without the main method
Constructor calling and object assigning outside the method 
Instance method calling by making object static outside the method

OBJECT TYPECASTING
---------------------	
Converting from one type of object to another type of object is known as object type casting.
Parent class reference can be used to hold its child class object also known as UPCASTING
Runnable r = new Thread();
Interface reference an be used to hold it's implementation class object.:- UPCASTING

Object o = new String("abc");
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer)o;
A b = () d;
A->class name / interface name
B->object reference
C->class name
D->object reference.

Step 1:-
Compile time checking 1
-----------------------
There must be some relation betwen c and d otherwise we will get CE saying incompatible types.
Object o = new String("abc");
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer)o;//NO ERROR

String o = new String("abc");
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer)o;//ERROR

Step 2: Compie time Checking
----------------------------
'c' must be either same as a or child class of a otherwise we will get CE saing incompatible types.
Object o = new String("abc");
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer)o;//NO ERROR

String o = new String("abc");
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer)o;//ERROR

Step 3: Runtime checking
------------------------
Runtime object of 'd' must be either same or child class of 'c' otherwise we will get RUNTIME EXCEPTION saying ClassCastException.
Object o = new String("abc");
StringBuffer sb = (StringBuffer)o;//ERROR

Example where all the 3 steps are checked

Integer I = new Integer(10);
Number n  = (Number)I;

Q: While object type casting whether  a new object is created or not.

No new object is created and the existing object gets a new reference during object typecasting.
