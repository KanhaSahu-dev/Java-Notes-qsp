The line which is not being executed and we get to know that it is an exception it is a checked exception

The line which has an exception and we know after the execution it is known as unchecked exception

We should try to write the exact exception other wise the time complexity increases with the normal Exception class.

Finally block is a block which will be executed to perform code clean up activity.

Throws() keyword
-----------------
It is the second way of handling the exception .
Throws keyword can only handle checked exception .

class demo{
    public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException{
        Thread.sleep(3000);
    }
}

Unchecked Exception
-------------------
throws cant handle unchecked exception
class demo{
    public static void main(String args[]) throws ArithmeticException{
        System.out.println(10/0);
    }
}
//cle

If we want to use our user defined class as a exception class then we have to make our user defined class as the child class of Throwable or it's type.

class demo extends Exception{
    public static void main(String args[]) throws Demo{
        System.out.println(10/0);
    }
}

Throw keyword
-------------
class demo extends ArithmeticException{
    public static void main(String args[]) throws ArithmeticException{
        throw new Demo();
    }
}
