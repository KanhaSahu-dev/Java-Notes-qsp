public static void m1(int x,double d){...}

public static void m1(double d,int x){...}

m1(10,10);// error since both methods will be called so error will be ambiguous.

If there is relation between the (parent and child) class arguments then the priority given to the child class.

public static void m1(String s){...}
public static void m1(Object o){...}

m1(null);// m1 String will be called and henceforth will be executed.

null is not a string type.

so when
public static void m1(String s){...}
public static void m1(class_name o){...}

m1(null); // error because null does not belong to anyone.

The priority always goes to the smallest child in a relationship no matter what .

Var Arg Method
---------------
A method which can be called by passing any number of arguments is known as var arg method.

public void m1(int... x){...} // var arg method

We can call var arg method by passing any number of arguments including 0.

The question arises how more than one values can be passed into the same argument that is x and still there is no error. Actually there is an internal conversion of 1 dimensional array is converted.

Wherever there is one dimensional array it can be replaced with var arg but vice versa is not true.

var arg method has the least priority no matter what.
class Test{
public static void main(String... args){

m1(); // Bye
m1(10,20,30); // Bye
m1(10); // Hii
}

public static void m1(){}

public static void m1(int... a){}



}

Can we overload main method?
