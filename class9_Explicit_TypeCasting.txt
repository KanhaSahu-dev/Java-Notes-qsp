Explicit Type casting
-------------------
int x = 10;
byte b = (byte)x;
sopln(b); // 10.

Only for explicit primitive datatype
--------------------------------

Programmer is responsible explicit type casting.
Whenever we are assigning a bigger data type value to a smaller data type variable explicit type casting willl be performed.
Explicit type casting is also known as downcasting or narrowing .
There may be some loss of information.

After conversion from int 130 to byte then the result will be -126 as it follows a cycle.
