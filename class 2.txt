Non static and local variable name can be same 

e.g.,
class A{
int x = 10;
psvm(---){
int x = 20;
sopln(x); // 20 bcoz it is the immediate member.

A a = new A();
sopln(a.x);
}
}

Local variable and static variable name can be same 

class A{
static int x = 10;
psvm(---){
int x = 20;
sopln(x); // 20 bcoz it is the immediate member.

A a = new A();
sopln(a.x);
}
}

To know whether different types of variables can be of the same names we should check the access methods

Three types of operators are there which are unary binary and ternary.
operands a,b,c
operators +-/* .

pre inc = increment by 1 happens before the operation
post inc = increment by 1 happens after the operation

Unary operator is applicable for every primitive data types except boolean.

byte b = 10;
b++;
sopln(b);

int x = 10
x++;
sopln(x);

double d = 10.5;
d++;
sopln(d); 11.5

char x = 'a';
x++;
sopln(x); b

boolean b= false;
x++;
sopln(x); CE
