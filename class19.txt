Constructors
------------
Whenever we create an object some piece of code will be executed automatically to perform initialization of an object, that piece of code is nothing but constructor.

1.Constructor is a special type of method which will be executed everytime whenever we create an object to perform initialization of an object.

Note: If we are creating a constructor with the name different from class name then we will get CE saying invalid declaration.

2.Return type concept is not applicable for constructor even void also.

Note: Method name and class name can be same with no problem.

3. If we provide return type to a constructor the compiler or JVM will not give any error and it will be treated as normal method.
class a{
void a(){}} It is a method not a constructor.

4.All access modifiers are applicable for constructor.

5. Non access modifiers are not applicable for constructor.

6.If we declare constructor as priate then we cant access constructor outside the class or we restrict object creation inside any other class.

class Demo{
p s v m(...){
	Test t = new Test();
}
}

class Test{
p s v m(...){
	private Test(){}
}
}

There are 2 types of constructors:-
	1) No arguments constructors. ()
	2) Parameterised constructors. (int x)

Case 1: If we are declaring a constructor then the first statement should either be call to super or this() , if we do not write , the compiler by default palces the call to super is placed.

class Demo{
Demo(){
super(); // If not written then by default call to super happens.
sopln("Hello World");
}
}

case 2: We can't write super() or this() simultaneously.

class Demo{	// This will show error.
Demo(){
super(); 
this();
}
}

Case 3: If we try to write call to super()  or this() anywhere except constructor then we will get CE.

class A{
public void m1(){
super(); 	// Only allowed in constructor not anywhere.
sopln("hii");
}
}

Default constructor
-------------------
-Compiler generates the default constructor.
-If there is no constructor inside a class then compiler generates default constructor.
-Every class in java contains constructor either default constructor generated by compiler or custormized constuctor generated by programmer.
-Every default constructor is a no argument constructor.

class a{
a(){	// default constructor and it is not visible.
super();
}
}

-Every default constructor is a no argument constructor but every no argument constructor is not a default constructor.
-The default constructor will have same access modifier which a class will have i.e., public and default.
