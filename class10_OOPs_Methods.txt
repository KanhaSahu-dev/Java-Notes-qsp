METHODS :-

Method is the set or block of codes which is used to perform a particular task.
	modifiers return-type methodName(parameter/arguments){ body }

MethodName
Method name always starts with lower case e.g., main(),concat(),append().
If a method name contains more than one word then method name always starts with lower case but every inner word should start with upper case . This is called as camel's rule.

There are only 2 types of methods in java
1.Static method 
2.Non Static method 

Static method which is represented by static modifier is known as static method.
A method which is not delclared as static is known as non static method.

Main method starts with main method and ends with main method.

If we want to execute the codes present inside m1 method present inside m1 method then we need to call the method .

Calling a method 
----------------

Calling a method means go to that method , execute the codes present inside that methods and come back.

Calling a static method :-
We can call static method by the following ways    directly,    by object,   by class name.

Calling a non static method :-
We can call non static method by the object.


Method Argument
-----------------

It is just like an input to a method
Argument of a method is optional.
There are 2 types of method argument
1. Primitive data type

public vodi m1(int x){

}

2. Non primitive data type

public void m1(String x){}

Calling a method with primitive datatype

p s v m (___){
m1(10);
m2(10.5);
m3(true);}}

Calling a method with non primitive as an argument
------------------------------------------------
We can call a method with non primitive as an argument by the following 2 ways:-
	1) By passing  object of the same type as an argument .
	2) By passing null as an argument.
class B{
	p s v m(...){
	{
	sopln("hii");
}
p s v m(---){
m1("abc");
m1(new String());
m1(null);
}
}

}

class Test{
p s v m1(Test t){
	sopln("hii");
}
p s v m(--){
m1(new Test());
m1(null);
}


}


Return type of a method
-----------------------

It is just like an output to a method .There are 3 types of return types 1.void 2.primitive 3.non primitive.
If a method has return type as void then it does not any value when called .
Main method is static bcoz the jvm doesnt need to make an object.

Primitive return type 
-------------------
If a method has any return type except void then it is mandatory to write a return statement inside that method .
if return statement is absent then the error will called as missing return statement.
p s v m(int x){
sop("hii");
}
p s v m(___){
m(10);//hii
}
