public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass outerInstance = new OuterClass();
        
        // Can create instance of InnerClass only with instance of OuterClass
        InnerClass innerInstance = outerInstance.new InnerClass();
        innerInstance.printOuterField();
    }

In this example, InnerClass is an inner class of OuterClass. You can only create an instance of InnerClass by using an instance of OuterClass.
